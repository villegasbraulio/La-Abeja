# Architecture Decision Records

One file per durable architectural or significant technical decision.

## Status meanings

- `proposed`: under consideration or based on an unconfirmed assumption.
- `accepted`: confirmed by user instruction, repository evidence, or external authority.
- `superseded`: replaced by a newer ADR; retained for history.
- `rejected`: considered but intentionally not adopted.

## Decision provenance

Use one or more labels:

- `USER_INSTRUCTION`
- `REPOSITORY_EVIDENCE`
- `EXTERNAL_AUTHORITY`
- `AGENT_ASSUMPTION`

A decision based only on an unconfirmed `AGENT_ASSUMPTION` cannot be `accepted`.

## Creating an ADR

1. Copy `TEMPLATE.md`.
2. Use the next sequential four-digit ID.
3. Name it `NNNN-short-kebab-case-title.md`.
4. Keep it focused on one durable decision.
5. Add or update its row in this index.
6. Link superseded and replacement ADRs in both directions.
